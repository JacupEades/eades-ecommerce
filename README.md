# Eades Ecommerce
This is my first big project using the MERN Stack.
Total time to complete 68 hours over 3 months while wiring a three-story house alone.
This Project was built following the Udemy course created by Ryan Dhungel.

The goal of the project for me is to learn as many aspects of how front-end and back-end communicate, and to provide proof that I am capable of learning and commiting to such a large project. 
Eades Ecommerce has a LOT of styleing issues as of 2/10/2023, but creating a very flashy site was not the goal. Creating a functional site that can collect user requests, display database information, and potentially collect income was the goal.
